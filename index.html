			<p>We don't sign superstars, we make them.
             When you give success to stupid people, it makes them more stupid sometimes and not more intelligent
             What does Arsenal mean?
             Arsenal is in my blood as well as my heart.
             I really like Arsenal.
             Arsenal are the most beautiful club in England.

			<p> since i hate this club and wouldn't like to be mean, i will just put in sir alex ferguson's words.
				Sir Alex Ferguson was basically, a poet. He coined the phrase "born offside" to describe Filippo Inzaghi's playing style. Both of those quotes are per a list of his greatest hits in the Guardian, and the entire thing is well worth a read.

			<h2 class="chelsea">CHELSEA</h2>
			<p>Like many professional English clubs, The Blues encapsulate their morals and beliefs with a Latin motto. Chelsea's mantra of 'Nisi Dominus Frustra' translates into English as meaning 'Without God, it is in vain'.

			<h2 class="liverpool">LIVERPOOL</h2>
			<p>For a player to be good enough to play for Liverpool, he must be prepared to run through a brick wall for me then come out fighting on the other side.” “I always said we had the best two teams on Merseyside… Liverpool and Liverpool Reserves.” “Some people believe football is a matter of life and death.

			<p>Well that didn’t go to plan did it? Fair play to Arsenal they’ve done the double over us for the first time since 2003, we made a single mistake and they punished us, but the reaction on social media was incredible hilarious, I saw multiple tweets suggesting we could lose two cup finals, finish fifth because Liverpool will be one point behind us if they win their two games in hand.
